## What packages to use in python

In order to install the needed packages inn python. Open your favourite terminal and enter the following

```
This will install requests. In older versions of python we need to install it. But in later version it comes on it's own
```
pip install pandas
```
This will install pandas. A library which is must need for most of the data scientist.
